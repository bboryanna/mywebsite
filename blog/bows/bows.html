  Even with the fast moving fashion sycle we are in right now, 
  bows are still managing to keep their populatity for quite a while now.
   I have to admit i was really suprised by this thinking the trend would die really fast
    just like its sudden rise. One of the main reasons 
    i suppose bows are still admired by many is because of their adaptive nature and ability
     to be incorporated in various styles and garments or used as an accessorie.

  In summary I think what everyone should take away from this trend is
   the ability to incorporate different elements they admire 
   into their personal style and not be fooled by the endless sycle of overconsumption 
  by buying tons of new clothes just to fit the aesthetic.
