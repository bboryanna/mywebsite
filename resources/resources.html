  <h1>Things I've Used In The Creation Of My Gorgeous Website</h1>

    Probably the best online resouces when it comes to any coding tutorial.

    Before starting i actually reffered to an youtube tutorial. This is the 
    <a href="https://youtu.be/G3e-cpL7ofc?si=-009lH_XuRz6l3b_" target="_blank">one</a>
    I watched and can quite confidently recomend. I don't even think you need
    to finish the whole video, but even a small part familiarises you 
    with some key concepts that will deffenetly be useful in the future.
    Honorable mentions are for example how to set up your coding enviroment and which one to pick.
    I use VS Code for example, but you can even use notepad or notepad++,
    which is even more simple.

    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_positioning.asp" target="_blank">CSS The position Property</a> and 
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_display.php" target="_blank">CSS display Property</a>
    In my opinion these two properties are the two most important to know when creating your website.
     Whenever an element was not showing up on the page the way i wantet in to it was most likely due to wrong configuration
     of one of these two properties.
     So yes If things are not showing up the way you would expect them check out if the problem is because of them. 
     So many times I would be wondering, 
     trying diffrent things and in the end teh solution will be most likely changing the display from inline to block for example.
     Familiarise yourself with them before starting anything and work your way up
     from the more simple stuff to the more complicated things. Know the basics.
